(1,2): Error RZ1024: End of file or an unexpected character was reached before the "foo" tag could be parsed.  Elements inside markup blocks must be complete. They must either be self-closing ("<br />") or have matching end tags ("<p>Hello</p>").  If you intended to display a "<" character, use the "&lt;" HTML entity.
